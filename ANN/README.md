[**1. Forecast electrical energy output of a Power Plant using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)	(August 2021)**](https://github.com/BearsOnMars/Deep_Learning/blob/main/ANN/Regression/ANN_for_Regression.ipynb)

  **Situation:** 
  Predict the net-hourly electrical energy output of the plant over next 15 months
  
  **Task:** 
  Design the project, develop ML approach, code in python, Data Pre-processing, Build-Initialise-Train multi-layered sequential ANN from Keras Tensorflow library
  
  **ML Approach:**
  Time-Series forecasting, Deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Regression, optimising Loss function (RMSE in this case) via Backpropagation (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
  
  **Result:**
  RMSE convergence achieved in 26-27 range. Predicted hourly-output very close to actual values
